## Infant Mortality Analysis: Data-Driven Insights on Fatal Causes Despite Healthcare Advances

Infant mortality remains one of the most critical indicators of public health and social development worldwide. Despite significant advancements in healthcare technology and prenatal care, many regions still face high rates of infant deaths due to various preventable causes.

This project analyzes infant mortality trends from **2000 to 2024** across different countries and regions, focusing on:

- **Time-based trends:** How infant mortality rates have changed globally and regionally over the last two decades  
- **Cause-based analysis:** Leading fatal causes such as respiratory diseases, infections, and birth complications  
- **Healthcare access impact:** Correlating infant death rates with healthcare infrastructure and prenatal care availability  
- **Demographic factors:** Insights based on maternal age, birth weight, and premature birth prevalence

Using publicly available datasets from trusted sources like the **World Health Organization (WHO)**, **Our World in Data (OWID)**, and the **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)**, this project demonstrates:

-  Data cleaning and preprocessing techniques  
-  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with rich visualizations (time series, maps, demographic breakdowns)  
-  Potential clustering or grouping of countries based on infant mortality characteristics  
-  Storytelling through data to highlight ongoing challenges and opportunities for improving infant health outcomes

The project is built using Python libraries including **pandas**, **matplotlib**, **seaborn**, and interactive tools like **plotly**.
